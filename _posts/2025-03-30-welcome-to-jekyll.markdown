Hello there!

My name is Adam, and I’m currently pursuing a **Master of Information Technology** at the **University of Melbourne**, where I specialise in **Artificial Intelligence**. My biggest passions in life are music, psychology, and of course, tech. Having pursued tertiary education in all three of these areas, I get great pleasure out of thinking about and exploring their intersection. As I continue my studies in AI, I’m constantly building new technical skills and challenging myself to think deeply about complex problems. I hope to share some of that experience here with you!

Thanks for joining me, and I hope you enjoy reading my posts!

Stay curious,  
Adam
